# GridProject

In order to understand the Grid concept i've made this project.
By combining the Media Queries, Flexbox and Grid concept i made my portfolio.
Properties which i got to know were grid-template-row, grid-template-columns, gap, grid-row, grid-column etc.
This portfolio is completely responsive and user friendly.
With all the CSS properties which i learned till now has been applied to make this portfolio.
I've also added some JavaScript to make some divs visible or hidden when clicked on menu or navigation list.
